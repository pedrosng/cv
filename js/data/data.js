      "Software Engineer with a strong background in Java and JavaScript, currently working as a Technical Analyst at Natixis, contributing to the development, maintenance, and evolution of large-scale financial systems in a highly regulated, production-critical environment." +
      "At Natixis, I work on core business systems, including the refactoring and redesign of critical trade import mechanisms, improving scalability, modularity, and long-term maintainability. I also contribute to feature development, incident resolution, and close collaboration with product and business teams." +
      "Previously, I spent six years at Code for All — a hybrid software house and programming school — where I worked as a fullstack engineer and technical instructor. I helped build internal learning platforms, designed and delivered intensive bootcamps and online courses, and mentored developers and instructors, supporting hundreds of people in their transition into tech." +
      "Earlier in my career, I spent over a decade as a railway engineer with Dragados SA and Mota-Engil, delivering complex infrastructure projects across Portugal and the UK. This experience strengthened my abilities in systematic problem solving, cross-functional collaboration, process optimization, and long-term planning — skills that I now apply to designing robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems." +
      "Outside of work, I’m passionate about literature, science (both fiction and non-fiction), and rock climbing — interests that reflect my curiosity, long-term mindset, and appreciation for challenge and continuous improvement."
